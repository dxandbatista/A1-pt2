For the API we created to represent Objects, we store each Object's hash value as a long unsigned int since standard libraries (and thus size_t) are prohibited. The methods that all Objects should have are equals, hash, and hash_me, where hash_me is just a way to generate a hash code for the Object should it be needed. 

Our Queue class implements the Object class and contains two fields, the array of Object data that is queued and the current size of the Queue. It can enqueue an Object (add an item to its queue of data), or enqueue all the Objects in another Queue (combine Queues). It can dequeue an Object (remove the head item and return it accordingly), or dequeue all Objects from this Queue. The peek method returns the Object at the head of the queue without dequeueing it. The contains method checks to see if the given Object is already in the Queue currently. It has a method to print out the queue size so we know how many items are in the queue currently, and a method to print out the contents of the queue so we know what items are in the queue currently.
