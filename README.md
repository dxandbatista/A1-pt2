The APIs for our Object and String classes are taken directly from the communal repository created by Chase Bishop, in an attempt to standardize these classes for easier usage between members of the company when creating our projects for higher management. As such, Object has two virtual methods of equals(Object* other) and hash(), while Strings have those plus methods cmp(String* s) to compare the lexicographical values of two Strings, concat(String* s) to concatenate two Strings together, and size() to return the current size of the String.    

Our Queue class implements the Object class. It can enqueue an Object (add an item to its queue of data), or enqueue all the Objects in another Queue (combine Queues). It can dequeue an Object (remove the head item and return it accordingly), or dequeue all Objects from this Queue. The peek method returns the Object at the head of the queue without dequeueing it. The contains method checks to see if the given Object is already in the Queue currently. It has a method to print out the queue size so we know how many items are in the queue currently, and of course the virtual Object methods of equals(Object* other) and hash().
